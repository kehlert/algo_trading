IMPORTANT NOTE: Github's servers sporadically don't render the Jupyter notebooks. If that's the case, then you can still view the notebook by copy-pasting it's URL at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.

A few of the notebooks are examples from "Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading" by Cartea, Jaimungal, and Penalva. Another notebook is based on Glasserman's book "Monte Carlo Methods for Financial Engineering" and a paper of his on optimal drift for path-dependent options.

These are just bits of code related to examples I wanted to try out myself. I also used some of the code and figures for teaching/talks.
